# The Unscientific Love Compatibility Calculator API
## Coding Assessment

### The Task
Implement a REST API with a single method that will perform a calculation using the `Classic love compatibility` algorithm to return the compatibility result.

### Running The App
You'll first need to install all the dependencies. 
```shell
npm install
```
Once all the dependencies have successfully been installed, you can run the application with the following command:
```shell
npm run start
```
### Assumptions
- Request body is in JSON format
- Two names are required for the function to work
- Only two names can be provided at a time
- Only the first names should be provided
- I could use Express
- Unit & Integration tests aren't necessary
### What I Would Have Added (done differently)
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Cleaned up the duplicate code
- Used a linter (I know I made some weird mistakes)
